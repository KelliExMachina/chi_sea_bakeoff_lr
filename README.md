![bakeoff](https://media.giphy.com/media/WvRgv9DdgJtPcIlTEI/giphy.gif)

For this challenge, will be asked to predict house prices in the King County, Washington.  

## Data files
1. Training data
> Labeled training data can be found in the kc_house_data_train.csv file

2. Test features
> An unlabeled test feature set can be found in kc_house_data_test.csv

The instructions for this bakeoff are limited with regards to modeling. You will be given **3 hours** to build your best model using the training data. 
Once you are satisfied with your model, or you find time runing out, use the kc_house_data_test.csv to predict a price for each of the 4323 house records.  

Save your predictions in a csv file with the following pattern. 
> housing_preds_<your initials>.csv
For example, Brian's submission would look like housing_preds_bm.csv

> There are different ways to turn arrays to csv's.  You can use any method you choose, but be sure your submission has no heading, no heading and one column.

> Slack your submission to the seattle-chicago-ds-012720 channel before time is up.

# Metric
Test results will be scored by RMSE.  The lowest RMSE receives bragging rights that span from the Midwest to the Pacific coast.
